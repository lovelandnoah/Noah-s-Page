				Well I enjoy longboarding, video games, gymnastic stuff, and computery stuff.

				I love longboarding from the first real time I did it I just fell in love with it. That being said its super dangerous like crazy and yes I've gotten hurt but not crazy bad.

				I'm more of a classic gamer. I played the Super Nintendo alot as a kid but then I had a original Xbox for a long time, and then had a 360 and yes I am an Xbox guy in and out if that wasn't clear but I will say that PlayStation is awesome alone just for having Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.

				I did gymnastics as a kid but stopped when I was young, but I still love those trampoline places.

				I like to fiddle with technology, not so much like taking it apart but more along the lines of seeing what I can do with it. Like things that are already on it or apps or things downloaded from the internet. That sort of stuff.
