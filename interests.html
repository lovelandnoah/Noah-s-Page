				<p style="text-align:center" class="littlepadding"> Here are some of my interests and disinterests. <br><br>Starting with Interests I love most too all nerdy things. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Dr. Who. Yeah just all kinds of nerdy things, I also LoVe board games and card games, and I love the ocean. <br><br> Disinterests I'm not giant into sports, I like to play them though except basketball I suck at basketball, but I can shoot ok. And I don't mind watching sports but I'll never go off and watch them. Umm I don't know much about politics and don't really care for them, I find it's useally the guy who talks the loudest or longest wins which I is pointless, that being said I wish I would learn more about them and keep up but I don't.</p>
